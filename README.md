# Would You Rather?

This project allows users to generate random would-you-rather questions centered around whether you would would rather fight a few large animals or many small animals. 

e.g. Would you rather fight 2 gorilla-sized scorpions or 100 scorpion-sized gorillas?

# How it works

There is an array of 22 large animals and an array of 22 small animals. When the user clicks the button on the site, the code randomly selects a big animal and a small animal. Then it randomly picks a number between 2 and 5 for the number of large animals and a random number between 30 and 70 for the number of small animals. The numbers and animals are then formatted into a would you rather question like the one above that is placed in the empty P tag.
